        <h2> Major Automotive Manufacturers of India</h2>
        <p>In 1897, the first car ran on an Indian road. Through the 1930s, cars were imports only, and in small numbers.An embryonic automotive industry emerged in India in the 1940s.<br>Hindustan Motors was launched in 1942 building Morris products, long-time competitor Premier in 1944, building Chrysler Corporation products such as Dodge and Plymouth, and beginning in the 1960s, Fiat products.</br>
             Mahindra & Mahindra was established by two brothers in 1945 and began assembly of Jeep CJ-3A utility vehicles.<br>In the same years, J. R. D. Tata, the chairman of Tata Group founded TATA Engineering and Locomotive Company (now Tata Motors) in Jamshedpur. Following independence in 1947, the Government of India and the private sector launched efforts to create an automotive-component manufacturing industry to supply to the automobile industry.</br>
             In 1953, an import substitution programme was launched, and the import of fully built-up cars began to be restricted.
             In 1952, the Indian government appointed the first Tariff Commission, whose purpose was to come out with a feasibility plan for the indigenization of the Indian automobile industry.</p>
